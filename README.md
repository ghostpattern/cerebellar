# About

Cerebellar is an interactive narrative for two players, made during [Train Jam 2016](https://itch.io/jam/train-jam-2016). This repository contains all of its source code and files.

In Cerebellar, two players on one keyboard control a pair of characters before and after their atoms are overlapped.

Cerebellar was developed by [Ghost Pattern](http://ghostpattern.net/), the collaboration between [Jason Bakker](http://twitter.com/jason_bakker) and [Russell Dilley](http://twitter.com/russelldilley). The audio was created by [Tomás Batista](http://tomasbatista.com/).

Cerebellar was built in Unity 5.3.4f1 using the [ink](http://www.inklestudios.com/ink/) scripting language, which was released as an open source project at GDC 2016 by its developer Inkle. Read more about Cerebellar and how it uses ink [here](http://ghostpattern.net/2016/04/04/cerebellar-is-now-open-source).

Cerebellar the game is freely available to download from [itch.io](https://ghostpattern.itch.io/cerebellar).

**Note:** Cerebellar uses an alpha version of ink, so there are some differences in format between what’s in our game and the latest version. These differences include:
 - Ink.Story.Begin no longer needs to be called.
 - Ink.Story is no longer created through a static factory method.
 - The ink syntax for "~ include" is now "INCLUDE".
